Project Title: Automotive Cybersecurity Vulnerability Analysis and AutoGuardX Framework
1. Introduction

The automotive industry is undergoing a significant digital transformation. Modern vehicles increasingly rely on interconnected software systems, wireless communication technologies, and intelligent electronic control units (ECUs). While these advancements improve convenience, efficiency, and user experience, they also introduce critical cybersecurity risks. Vehicles now function as complex cyber-physical systems, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals seeking unauthorized access, data theft, and vehicle theft.

This project is developed within the domains of Cybersecurity and IT Project Management and focuses on identifying, analyzing, and mitigating cybersecurity vulnerabilities in contemporary vehicles.

2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this research project are:

To identify cybersecurity vulnerabilities present in modern automotive systems

To analyze real-world attack vectors and threat scenarios affecting vehicles

To assess the impact of these vulnerabilities on vehicle safety, privacy, and asset protection

To propose a structured and scalable cybersecurity solution for automotive systems

To align cybersecurity practices with IT project management frameworks

3. Scope of Research

This project examines cybersecurity weaknesses across key automotive components, including:

Keyless entry and immobilizer systems

In-vehicle networks (e.g., CAN bus and related protocols)

Onboard Diagnostics (OBD-II) interfaces

External communication interfaces (Bluetooth, cellular, Wi-Fi, GPS)

The research evaluates how these components can be exploited through cyber-attacks and the implications of such compromises.

4. Proposed Solution: AutoGuardX

A major contribution of this project is AutoGuardX, a comprehensive automotive cybersecurity framework designed to prevent and mitigate cyber-enabled vehicle theft.

AutoGuardX Key Features:

Layered security architecture (prevention, detection, response)

Integration of technical security controls

Risk management and threat assessment practices

Governance principles aligned with cybersecurity standards

Alignment with IT Project Management best practices

AutoGuardX is designed to be adaptable, scalable, and suitable for integration into modern vehicle security programs.

5. Methodology

The research methodology includes:

Literature review of automotive cybersecurity threats

Analysis of real-world attack scenarios
